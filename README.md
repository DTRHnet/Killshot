**Killshot: Enhancing Awareness of WPS Protocol Security Flaws**

Killshot is a project dedicated to highlighting the security vulnerabilities present in the WPS protocol. Despite being considered 'outdated', many devices remain vulnerable as of 2024, leaving the home networks of unsuspecting families and businesses exposed to various attacks.

The name 'Killshot' is inspired by a wordplay on the project 'Oneshot' by [Name], featured in Kali Nethunter, which quickly identified network vulnerabilities. Killshot builds on this concept by taking the automation of vulnerability detection a step further.

This project offers multiple modes to automate the entire process while wardriving, emphasizing clean, modular code. Additionally, it incorporates a TUI mode for real-time data display, utilizing tmux and the libtmux API.

Above all, Killshot serves as a platform for enhancing my coding skills and deepening my understanding of technical concepts. Expect this fully automated and fine-tuned tool to be controllable via various means if that is of interest.
